# 32-bit_Single_Cycle_3_buses_RICS-V_processor
I've developed a 32-bit non-pipelined RISC-V processor using Microprogramming, specifically implementing the RV32I instruction set architecture. This processor features a 3-bus structure and covers a wide range of essential instruction types:

1. **Computational Instructions**: The processor efficiently handles all computational instructions encompassed by instruction types R and I. This includes operations such as addition, subtraction, logical operations, and more, ensuring optimal data processing capabilities.

2. **Memory Access Instructions**: Our processor is equipped to execute memory access instructions, including both load and store operations. This means it can seamlessly read from and write to memory locations, facilitating data manipulation and storage as required by the I and S type instructions.

3. **Control Flow Instructions**: The processor also supports Control Flow instructions of type SB, enabling smooth branching and conditional execution within programs. This capability enhances program control and decision-making processes.

This project represents a significant milestone in the development of a capable and versatile RISC-V processor, and it's now available on GitHub for exploration, collaboration, and further development. Feel free to delve into the code, contribute, or reach out for any inquiries. Together, we can advance the realm of processor design and architecture. Explore the project on GitHub to dive into the details and be part of this exciting journey.
